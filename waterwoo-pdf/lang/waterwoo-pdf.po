"Watermark PDF for WooCommerce is a plugin that adds a watermark to every "
"page of your PDF file(s). The watermark is customizable with font face, font "
"color, font size, placement, and text. Not only that, but since the "
"watermark is added when the download button is clicked (either on the "
"customer's order confirmation page or email), the watermark can include "
"customer-specifc data such as the customer's first name, last name, and "
"email. Your watermark is highly customizable and manipulatable."
