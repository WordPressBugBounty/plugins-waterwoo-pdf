"PDF Ink Lite is a plugin that can add a watermark to every page of your PDF file(s). The watermark "
"is customizable with font face, font color, font size, placement, and text. Not only that, but "
"since the watermark is added when the download button is clicked (either on the customer's order "
"confirmation page or email), the watermark can include customer-specifc data such as the customer's "
